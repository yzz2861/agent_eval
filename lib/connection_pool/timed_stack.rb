# The TimedStack manages a pool of homogeneous connections (or any resource
# you wish to manage). Connections are created lazily up to a given maximum
# number.
#
# Examples:
#
#    ts = TimedStack.new(size: 1) { MyConnection.new }
#
#    # fetch a connection
#    conn = ts.pop
#
#    # return a connection
#    ts.push conn
#
#    conn = ts.pop
#    ts.pop timeout: 5
#    #=> raises ConnectionPool::TimeoutError after 5 seconds
